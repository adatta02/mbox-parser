mbox-parser
===========

My second adventure into Scala land. Basically, this will parse a .mbox inbox backup  that you can download using Google's Takeout service and then insert that data into MySQL.

Why would you want to do that? Well it'll let you run analytics across your sent and received emails like you've never done before.
